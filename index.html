        <h1>Frozen food</h1>
        <h3>HISTORY</h3>
        Natural food freezing <b><i>(Using Winter Frosts)</i></b>had been in use by people
        in cold climates for centuries.
        In 1861 Thomas Sutcliffe Mort established at Darling Harbour in Sydney,
        Australia,<br> The world's first freezing works, which later became the
        New South Wales Fresh Food and Ice Company. Mort financed experiments
        by Eugene Dominic Nicolle, a French born engineer who had arrived 
        in Sydney in 1853 and registered his first ice-making patent in 1861.
        The first trial shipment of frozen meat to London was in 1868. 
        Although their machinery was never used in the frozen meat trade,
        Mort and Nicolle developed commercially viable systems for domestic
        trade. <br>The financial return on that investment was minimal for Mort.
        Regular shipments of frozen meat from Australia and New Zealand
        to Europe began in 1881, with a consignment of frozen New Zealand
        sheep exported to London on board the Dunedin. <hr>

<h3>TECNOLOGY</h3>
The freezing technique itself, just like the frozen food market,
is developing to become faster, more efficient and more cost-effective.
As demonstrated by Birdseye's work, faster freezing means smaller ice 
crystals and a better-preserved product.
